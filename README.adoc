= Clojure Map Destructing Demo

Live examples (via unit tests) of Clojure map destructuring techniques

== Overview

Clojure has many different ways to extract values from a map (i.e. hashmap):

- clojure.core/get
- keyword function syntax
- associative destructing
- `:keys` destructing

Each of the above provides a way to incorporate default values, and each can used either in a
'let' statement or in a function argument list (implicit 'let').

However, the best way to destructure a Clojure map (or to create one) is to use these macros
from the https://github.com/cloojure/tupelo[Tupelo Clojure] library:

- `(vals->map a b c)`
- `(with-map-vals m [a b c] ...)`

== How to User This Project

To use this project, we assume you have already installed Java, Clojure, and Leiningen, and `git`.

=== Clone the Project Using Git

Verify you have Git installed:

```bash
> git --version
git version 2.25.0
```

Use `git` to clone the project:
```bash
> git clone  git@github.com:io-tupelo-demo/map-destructure.git        # ssh clone
```

or, clone via HTTPS (if you don't have SSH set up on your computer & GitHub):
```bash
> git clone  https://github.com/io-tupelo-demo/map-destructure.git    # https clone
```

Then `cd` (change directory) into the new project:

```bash
> cd map-destructure
```

=== Verify you have Java & Clojure set up correctly

Try the following commands, and make sure you get similar output:

```bash

> java --version
java 24.0.1 2025-04-15
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 24.0.1+9-30)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.0.1+9-30, mixed mode, sharing)

~/io-tupelo-demo/map-destructure > clojure --version
Clojure CLI version 1.12.0.1530

```

== Running Unit Tests - Plain

I use the alias `ct` for "clojure-test" and `ctr` fr "clojure-test-refresh". You can copy that or just cut/paste
the actual commands echoed below.

With the alias:
```pre
> ct
 => time (clojure -X:test)    # <= actual command from alias

Running tests in #{"test"}
